# Custom ASIC Design & Fabrication

For my Senior Design project, our group is designing a custom Application Specific Integrated Circuit to test the limits of the eFabless process. Our main purpose is to identify the limits and establish the process of submitting a design to the open-source eFabless MPW shuttles so research groups and future senior design teams can create practical designs with the knowledge that the system has been tested, is known to be working, and what limits exist. We are creating a multi-part project, each submodule designed to test one part of the framework. From our project website, our group will perform the following tasks to test the limits of the eFabless MPW shuttles:

 * Implement clock gating to show the ability for designers to limit the power usage of unused components
 * Instantiate several standard cells provided by eFabless to show how to manually select and use specific cells from the library
 * Explore creating custom logic cells to possibly allow for higher density designs and expand beyond the standard cells provided
 * Ensure the design is modular so each submodule can be tested independently and one error cannot cause the entire project to fail
 * Use the wishbone bus provided in the wrapper project to learn how the wishbone bus operates in hardware
 * Use the provided tools to perform Register Transfer Language (RTL) simulations and Gate Level (GL) simulations to verify a design prior to fabrication
 * Provide any additional documentation on how we implemented each new portion of our project for future designers to reference



The working copy of our project website, availble at https://sddec23-06.sd.ece.iastate.edu has the project overview and more information about the project and the team, along with our weekly reports and design documents.
