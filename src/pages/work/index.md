# Work Experience

<div class="padding"></div>

## ISU Web Development
I joined the ISU Web Development team in October of my first year at ISU. We developed web pages for university groups using the Laravel framework in PHP with a MySQL backend server and Vue.JS frontend. I worked on several projects and led a few, enjoying the puzzles along the way. I really enjoyed working with the team and had a great experience learning PHP and growing my knowledge of Vue.JS, but once I got deep enough into my classes I realized that I preferred working in research learning more about the low-level processing and challenges facing physical hardware designs.

## Undergraduate Research with Dr. Duwe
I have been working with Dr. Duwe for about a year on various research tasks related to intermittent processing. See the <router-link class="normal" to="/projects">Projects</router-link> page for more information about these projects:

[**BOBBER iFPGA Accelerator** Improving the efficiency of an FPGA accelerator for intermittent computing](/projects/bobber)
[**Wireless Intermittent Testbed** Firmware design of an experimental testbed for wireless communication under intermittent power](/projects/testbed)
