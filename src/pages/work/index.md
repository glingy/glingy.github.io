# Work Experience

## Altec Summer Internship
This past summer I worked for Altec, primarily on their telemetry system which runs a custom Linux OS built using the Yocto build system with several C++ applications.

I went in knowing C++ and having worked with Yocto before on one of their [telemetry units donated to Solar Car](/projects/telem), but still learned a lot about code organization and different ways of setting up build systems. I got to work much more in-depth in creating a Yocto OS from the ground up for a new hardware design including kernel configuration as needed to enable hardware support for the various modules (or disable as the need be). I also learned the interesting dichotomy between SystemD and SysVInit and when one can be more useful than the other. They also did a lot more Python scripting as well in build systems and one-off low-performance applications than I had used in the past.

We used an Agile team management workflow, and I learned a lot about how their release process works to ensure that live OTA updates don't fail in the field.

## ISU Web Development
I joined the ISU Web Development team in October of my first year at ISU. We developed web pages for university groups using the Laravel framework in PHP with a MySQL backend server and Vue.JS frontend. I worked on several projects and led a few, enjoying the puzzles along the way. I really enjoyed working with the team and had a great experience learning PHP and growing my knowledge of Vue.JS, but once I got deep enough into my classes I realized that I preferred working in research learning more about the low-level processing and challenges facing physical hardware designs.

## Undergraduate Research with Dr. Duwe
I have been working with Dr. Duwe for about a year on various research tasks related to intermittent processing. See the [Projects](/projects) page for more information about these projects:

_[**BOBBER iFPGA Accelerator** Improving the efficiency of an FPGA accelerator for intermittent computing](/projects/bobber)_
_[**Wireless Intermittent Testbed** Firmware design of an experimental testbed for wireless communication under intermittent power](/projects/testbed)_
